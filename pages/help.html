<h2>Getting started With Red</h2><pre>

Basically, you need to download the Red system (very small) and use a text editor.
Ungaretti explains possibilities at:
<a href="http://helpin.red/">http://helpin.red/</a>

There is another editor by Mike Parr at:
<a href="http://www.mikeparr.info/redlang.html">http://www.mikeparr.info/redlang.html</a>

There are a number of advanced options (e.g. about compiling programs for different 
architectures), and these can be displayed by typing:

    red -h
    
at the Red console.

<h2>How to use Red By Example</h2> <pre>

1. if you know the word to search for, you can use the alphanumeric index
   on the INDEX page

2. if you are searching for a given functionality, try to browse the index
   per category on the INDEX page

3. if you remember part of a word use the browser search function by pressing CTRL+f
   on the INDEX page

4. when viewing a words' docs, you can immediately jump to any category it belongs to

5. in the INDEX page you can jump to the top of the page from anywhere

<h2>Some remarks concerning the examples</h2><pre>

1. falsey = (any expression evaluating to) none or false

2. functions getting wrong arguments generally produce a specific script error

3. this page is not intended to be used for Rebol - too many differences

4. returned value of a Red expression will appear as is in the text of a word doc

5. printed values will appear in blue in the text of a word doc

6. extra explanation will appear in green in the tex of a word doc
