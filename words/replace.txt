The word $$replace$$ replaces the search-value with the replace value 
in a $$series!$$.  

It can be used with strings, because a $$string!$$ is a $$series!$$.

It has 3 arguments:                       
    series          - the $$series!$$ to be modified.
    search-value    - the value to be replaced (any type)
    replace-value   - the value to replace with (any type)

The search is case-insensitive and only the first occurrence is replaced, 
unless the refinement /all is used. 

The replaced and replacing item can have a different length.

Refinements
    /all    -   replace all occurrences

Note that this is a destructive operation. It alters the $$series!$$
involved!
.pre
.box Replace a by W

red>> s: "abcde"
"abcde"

red>> replace s "a" "W"
"Wbcde"

red>> s
"Wbcde"

.box Note the case insensitivity here

red>> a-string: "The cat and the dog"
"The cat and the dog"

red>> replace a-string "the" "a"
"a cat and the dog"

.box Using the /all refinement

red>> river: "Mississippi"
"Mississippi"

red>> replace/all river "is" "IS"
"MISsISsippi"

.box A series of numbers

red>> nums: [21 22 23 -1 44 45 46]
[21 22 23 -1 44 45 46]

red>> replace nums -1 [33 34 35]
[21 22 23 33 34 35 44 45 46]

red>> replace nums [21 22 23] -1
[-1 33 34 35 44 45 46]
