The word $$dirize$$ turns its argument into a valid directory.

The argument can be of $$file!$$ $$string!$$ $$url!$$.

Effectively $$dirize$$ only appends a trailing / if needed.
.pre
red>> dirize "/e/src"
== "/e/src/"            %%Note trailing / appended%%

red>> dirize %/e/src
== %/e/src/             %%Note trailing / appended%%

red>> dirize %/e/src/
== %/e/src/             %%Nothing happened - directory was already valid%%

red>> dirize %.
== %./                  %%Note trailing / appended%%
