The infix word $$-$$ subtracts its second operand from its first operand.
It is the equivalent of the $$subtract$$ function.

It operates on these types:
   $$number!$$ $$char!$$ $$pair!$$ $$tuple!$$ $$vector!$$ $$time!$$ $$date!$$

In Red, infix operators are evaluated from left to right, with no precedence.
You may use parentheses ( ) to change the order of evaluation.

The operator $$-$$ is a Red word and thus needs to be separated by whitespace.

In general, the type of the result is the same type as the first operand,
where this is sensible. Errors will result when the types are incompatible.

Note the result when vectors of different lengths are subtracted.

When we subtract 2 vectors, the result is a freshly allocated vector.
When we subtract a number from a vector, the original vector will be modified.
