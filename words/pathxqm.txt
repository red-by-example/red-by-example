The word $$path?$$ returns $$true$$ if its argument is a $$path!$$ type.
Otherwise $$false$$.

Its single argument can be of any type.

There are several types of $$path!$$ related words:
   $$path!$$ $$lit-path!$$ $$set-path!$$ $$get-path!$$

To test if an argument is any of these types, use $$any-path?$$.  
To restrict the test to $$path!$$ only, use $$path?$$

For more details on the ways of interpreting a word (involving ' and :), 
the reader should look at the entries on $$lit-word!$$ $$get-word!$$ and $$set-word!$$
