The word $$exclude$$ returns a new value, which is the first 
argument where elements of the second argument are excluded.  

With strings, difference in case is not significant.

The argument types can be: 
    $$block!$$ $$hash!$$ $$string!$$ $$bitset!$$ $$typeset!$$

Refinements:
    /case - use case sensitive comparison.
    /skip - treat the $$series!$$ as fixed size records.  
            Specify the size as an $$integer!$$.
