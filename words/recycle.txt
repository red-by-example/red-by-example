REFINEMENTS:
     /on          => 
     /off         => 
.dce
Triggers a manual garbage collection pass, rather than waiting for internal 
heuristics and timing events to do so. Recycle has 2 refinements: /off and /on.
They allow you to disable the garbage collector, and re-enable it. This 
gives you control in scenarios where you want to manage things more directly
yourself.
