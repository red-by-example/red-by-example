The word $$print$$ outputs its evaluated argument to the Red console, 
followed by a new-line: "^(line)".

The single argument can be any type (also a $$block!$$).  In this case
every block element is is evaluated.  If you don't want evaluation, 
investigate $$probe$$.

The twin word $$prin$$ does the same but without outputting new-line.
