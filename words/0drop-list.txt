This type represents a vertical list of text strings, displayed in a 
foldable frame. A vertical scrollbar appears automatically if the content 
does not fit the frame.

The default event handler is $$0on-change$$

The  $$0drop-down$$, $$0drop-list$$, and $$0text-list$$ are related.
A $$none$$ value for 'selection' is returned if no choice has been made.

A $$0drop-down$$ is similar, but it provides an additional edit field (a 
'combo').

The drop-list only displays strings, though the 'data' values can include 
other types. This can give an associative-array effect.  For example, to 
find the postage cost of a letter, we can use this in VID:

postal-drop-list: drop-list data["Basic" 33 "2nd-class" 40 "Priority" 99]

Only the 3 strings are displayed.

Multiplying the selected position by 2 would take us to the integer cost 
item.
