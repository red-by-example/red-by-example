This type represents a cursor which can be moved along a horizontal or 
vertical axis.  The optional value  for the initial position can be a 
percent, or a float between 0.0 and 1.0.

Its default event is: $$0on-change$$

Its current value is available in 'data'.

The default orientation is horizontal, because the default size for 
faces is wider than its height.  For a vertical slider, specify a 
size that is taller than its width.

Here is VID example where a slider's value is displayed in a $$text$$ 
and used to control a $$0progress$$ bar.  Note the use of 'face' to 
represent the current face.  We could also have written 'slider1'.

    slider1:  slider 20x100 50% [    ;--vertical, initially at middle
        mytext/text:  face/data  
        progress1/data: face/data
    ]
