The $$datatype!$$ $$hash!$$ provides a block-like interface but with fast 
lookups for most values (block series can be stored in hash! too, but they 
will not be hashed, so no faster access). 

It is a very flexible container for any kind of hashed tables (not only 
associative arrays) while keeping the handy navigational abilities of blocks.  

A hash might save time with large data sets and repeated searching.  

See also0 the $$datatype!$$ $$map!$$.
.pre
.box Create a hash!, and use it
red>> list: make hash! [a 123 "hello" b c 789]
== make hash! [a 123 "hello" b c 789]

red>> list/c
== 789

red>> find list 'b
== make hash! [b c 789]

red>> dict: make hash! [a 123 b 456 c 789]
== make hash! [a 123 b 456 c 789]

red>> select dict 'c
== 789

.box Regard DICT as 2 records of size 3 and find value 456
red>> select/skip dict 456 3
== 123
