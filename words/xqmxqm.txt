The word $$??$$ prints a Red $$word!$$ (given as its argument)
and the value it refers to, in a molded format. This means that
the output includes type information (e.g. [ ], " ").

It is very useful for debugging.

Warning: when used with a $$function!$$ name, it displays the 
         $$function!$$ specification, rather than evaluating 
         that $$function!$$.
