The word $$same?$$ returns $$true$$ if the arguments refer to 
identical objects, otherwise $$false$$. 

For example, $$true$$ would be returned if two strings are the 
same string (that is: they occupy the same memory location). 

The two arguments can be of any type.
.pre
.box Same string, but in differnet memory locations
red>> a: "fish"
 "fish"

red>> b: "fish"
"fish"

red>> same? a b
false

.box Same string and same memory location
red>> a: "meat"
"meat"

red>> b: a
"meat"

red>> same? a b
true
