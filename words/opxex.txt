The $$datatype!$$ $$op!$$ represents the Red functions that act as infix 
operators.

red>> ? op!
     %       =>  Returns what is left over when one value is divided by another
     *       =>  Returns the product of two values
     **      =>  Returns a number raised to a given power (exponent)
     +       =>  Returns the sum of the two values
     -       =>  Returns the difference between two values
     /       =>  Returns the quotient of two values
     //      =>  Compute a nonnegative remainder of A divided by B
     <       =>  Returns TRUE if the first value is less than the second
     <<             
     <=      =>  Returns TRUE if the first value is less than or equal 
                 to the second
     <>      =>  Returns TRUE if two values are not equal
     =       =>  Returns TRUE if two values are equal
     ==      =>  Returns TRUE if two values are equal, and also the 
                 same datatype
     =?      =>  Returns TRUE if two values have the same identity
     >       =>  Returns TRUE if the first value is greater than the second
     >=      =>  Returns TRUE if the first value is greater than or equal to 
                 the second
     >>             
     >>>            
     and     =>  Returns the first value ANDed with the second
     is      =>  Defines a local reactive relations inside a reactor
     or      =>  Returns the first value ORed with the second
     xor     =>  Returns the first value exclusive ORed with the second

red>> 1 + 2

red>> 2 * 5
== 10

red>> 10 / 2
== 5

red>> 10 // 2
== 0

red>> 10 // 3
== 1
