Moves one or more elements from one series to another position or series. 
By default, one element is moved.  The origin series is modified and 
returned. The target series is modified. 

Arguments

     origin -  a $$series!$$
     target -  a $$series!$$

Refinements
     /part - control the number of values inserted.  We supply an 
             $$integer!$$ length.

;move first element of s1 to s2
;note the returned value: a modified s1

;s1 is modified
