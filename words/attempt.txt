The word $$attempt$$ tries to evaluate a $$block!$$ 
and returns the result or $$none$$ if an error occurs.

The effect of $$attempt$$ is similar to that of error? try[block]. 
If you need more details about specific errors, look at $$try$$, 
$$cause-error$$ $$error?$$, and the $$error!$$ type.
