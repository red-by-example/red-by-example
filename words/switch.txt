The word $$switch$$ chooses a $$block!$$ based on a value.  

We provide a value (which can be an expression of any type), then a 
series of $$block!$$s, each prefixed with a value.  

The block associated with the matching value is evaluated.  
The prefixed values are not evaluated (Note that differing types are allowed).

The value of the last evaluation in the matched block is returned.

Refinements
    /default    -   allows us to specify a default $$block!$$ at 
                    the bottom of the $$switch$$, which is executed
                    when no value matches

.box We try to match on different datatypes here

switch 23.77.44  [ 
   1        [print "1: integer"]
   23.77.44 [print "23.77.44: a tuple"]
   "India"  [print "India: string"
             country: true]
]
##23.77.44: a tuple##

.box Using the /default refinement where nothing matches with "China"

item: "China"
switch/default item  [ 
   1        [print "1: integer"]
   23.77.44 [print "23.77.44: a tuple"]
   "India"  [print "India: string"
