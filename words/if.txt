The word $$if$$ evaluates a conditional expression. 
If the result thereof is $$true$$, the $$block!$$ will be evaluated. 
If $$false$$ nothing happens.

Has 2 parameters:
    1. a conditional expression
    2. a $$block!$$.

If returns the resulting value of the $$block!$$ if the condition is $$true$$ and 
else returns $$none$$.

Warning:
   The $$if$$ word is a pitfall for Red n00bs, because it doesn't have an $$else$$ $$block!$$.
   The $$either$$ word provides what programmers would expect.
