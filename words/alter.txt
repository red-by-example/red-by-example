The word $$alter$$ appends/removes a value to/from a $$series!$$.
The value can be of any type.

If the value does NOT exist in the $$series!$$ it is appended, and $$true$$ is returned.
The original $$series!$$ is modified.

If the value does exist, it is removed, and $$false$$ is returned.

Note that $$find$$ can be used to search a value in a $$series!$$.

There are no refinements.
