The word $$file?$$ returns $$true$$ if its argument is a $$file!$$.  

In Red, a $$file!$$ type value is preceded by %.  
If spaces are needed in a file name, enclose it in quotes or use hex %20, as in:
    %"my files/"
    %/my%20files/

In Windows the drive letter is part of the $$path!$$, like so:
    %/c/windows/system32/xyz.dll
    
Absolute $$path!$$s start with %/ and relative $$path!$$s just with %.

%%Relative path%%
