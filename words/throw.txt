Throws control to a $$catch$$. Note that $$catch$$ and throw are mainly 
intended for creating new control structures, and are not the main 
exception-handling functions.  For this, look at $$attempt$$, $$try$$, 
$$cause-error$$ $$error?$$, and $$error!$$.

For $$throw$$ examples, look at the entry for $$catch$$.
  
Arguments

The single argument value, can be any type, and will be the value returned 
from the matching $$catch$$.

Refinements
     /name - Throws to a named catch.  We supply a $$word$$.
