The word $$union$$ returns the union of 2 data sets.  
Duplicate entries are only included once.

A new $$series!$$ is produced, and the 2 arguments are unchanged.

Both series arguments must be of the same datatype, which can be:
    $$block!$$  $$hash!$$  $$string!$$  $$bitset!$$  $$typeset!$$

The word $$union$$ is one of several set-type functions.

Refinements:
    /case - use case-sensitive comparison
    /skip - treat the series as fixed size records. 
            Specify the size as an $$integer!$$
.pre
.box Union of 2 blocks
red>> union [1 2 99 4] [1 2 3 4]
== [1 2 99 4 3]

.box Union of 2 strings
red>> union "abcd" "Ab"
== "abcd"

; /case makes union case-sensitive
red>> union/case "abcd" "Ab"
== "abcdA"

red>> union/case ["a" "b"] [ "A"]
== ["a" "b" "A"]
