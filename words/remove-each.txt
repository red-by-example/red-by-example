Removes one or more values from a $$series!$$.  
A block is evaluated for each element, and the element is removed
if the block is $$true$$.  The original series is modified.

Arguments

word - a $$word!$$ or $$block!$$ of words to set.  
       These are used in the evaluation.  They are not local.

data - a $$series!$$, which includes $$string!$$

body - a $$block!$$ to be evaluated.
