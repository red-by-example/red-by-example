The $$form$$ word converts a value to a $$string!$$, in a user-friendly format.

NOTE that, depending on the type, the resulting text might not contain extra
     type information (such as [ ] { } and "") as would be produced by $$mold$$.

It has one argument, a value.

Refinements:
   /part - an $$integer!$$ value limiting the length of the result $$string!$$
.pre
Because the Red console has an effect on formatting, we will use print.

red>> print form "ABCDEFG"
##ABCDEFG##

red>> print form/part "ABCDEFG" 2
##AB##

red>> print form #"Z"
##Z##

red>> print form {The Great
    Wall Of
    China}
##The Great##
##Wall Of##
##China##

red>> print form [1 2 3 4 5 6]
##1 2 3 4 5 6##

red>> print form/part [1 2 3 4 5 6] 4
##1 2##
