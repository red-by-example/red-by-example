A paren! is a $$series!$$ of items enclosed in parentheses ( ).  It is 
evaluated when it is encountered, and a result is returned.

In Red, infix operators have no priority, and paren! types can sometimes add 
clarity.

.pre
.box Work with infix operators
red>> (1 + 2)
== 3

red>> 3 + ((4 + 5) * (2 + 3))
== 48

.box Preventing evaluation with e.g.  [ ]
red>> first [(2 + 3)]
== (2 + 3)

;a paren! is a series!
red>> first first [(2 + 3)]
== 2

;here 2 + 3 is evaluated first, so first tries to work on 5
red>> first (2 + 3)
*** Script Error: first does not allow integer! for its s argument
*** Where: first
