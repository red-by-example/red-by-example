Represents a window displayed on the OS desktop. 

In VID the window is made large enough to hold all the faces, but  we 
can  also choose our own fixed size.
The View Engine provides more facilities - such as handling a 
window-resize event, and adding a menu bar.  
In VID we can define a window like this:
view [
    size 350x450           ;-- window size
    title "Text faces"     ;-- window title

    t1: text "Hello"       ;-- rest of VID code
    ;-- etc
]
