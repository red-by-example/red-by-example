The word $$random$$ returns a random value of the same type as its single argument.
For certain types and refinements, it can shuffle or pick from a $$series!$$.

For an $$integer!$$ argument of value n, the random value is between 1 and n inclusive.

   /seed   - Restart or randomize
   /secure - Returns a cryptographically secure random $$number!$$
   /only   - Pick a random value from a $$series!$$
