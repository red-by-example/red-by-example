A drop-down represents an edit field with a vertical list of text strings 
displayed in a foldable frame. (i.e. a 'combo').   A vertical scrollbar 
appears automatically if the content does not fit the frame.

The default event handler is $$0on-enter$$.

The  $$0drop-down$$, $$0drop-list$$, and $$0text-list$$ are related.

A $$none$$ value for 'selection' is returned if no choice has been made.

The associative-array possibility exists, as in $$0drop-list$$

It is possible to preset the edit field, which might be used as an initial 
selection, or a prompt.  

Example in VID:
