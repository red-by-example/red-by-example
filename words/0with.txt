Evaluates a block of Red code bound to the currently defined face. Allows
directly setting the face fields, overriding other VID options.

Note that the $$0with$$ is executed as the face is created.  In the following,
if we reversed the order of b1 and b2, creating b2 first, an error would 
result, because b1 does not exist (yet).


view [   
    b1: button "Hello"       ;-- actually shows "HI!"
    b2: button "Goodbye"  with [b1/text: "HI!"]
]
