The word $$difference$$ returns the elements of two series 
that are not present in both. 

Both series arguments must be of the same datatype, which 
can be:
    $$block!$$ $$hash!$$ $$string!$$ $$bitset!$$ $$typeset!$$.

$$difference$$ in one of several set-style functions.

Refinements:
    /case - use case-sensitive comparison.
    /skip - treat the $$series!$$ as fixed size records. 
            Specify the size as an $$integer!$$.

red>> difference [1 2 99 4] [1 2 3 4]
== [99 3]

red>> difference ["cat" "dog"] ["dog" "mouse" "fish"]
== ["cat" "mouse" "fish"]

red>> difference "abcd" "Ab"
== "cd"

red>> difference/case "abcd" "Ab"
== "acdA"
