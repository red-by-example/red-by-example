The word $$none$$ is a special value, and its datatype is $$none!$$

$$none$$ is not the same as an empty $$block!$$, empty $$string!$$, 
zero $$number!$$ or null $$char!$$.

It is an actual value that represents non-existence.

$$none$$ is returned in certain circumstances from several functions,
primarily those involving $$series!$$.
