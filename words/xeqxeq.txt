The infix word $$==$$ strictly compares operands on its left and right side and
returns $$true$$ if the operand on the left is strictly equal to the operand on the
right. Otherwise returns $$false$$.

Has 2 operands of any $$datatype!$$.

The comparison is "strict", which means that:
    - numeric operands are not equal if they have a different datatype
    - string operands are not equal if their case differs
