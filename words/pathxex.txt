A $$path!$$ is used to access items, often those contained in larger 
structures.  The path! syntax is basically a series of items (including 
$$paren!$$) separated by '/', and is applicable to  a range of data types. 
It might help your understanding if you look at the lower-level 
$$get-word!$$, $$set-word!$$ and $$lit-word!$$ types first.   Here are some 
introductory examples of path!.

.box with series - string and block

red>> str: "ABCDE"

;get element 3
red>> str/3
== #"C"

;get element 2.  NB b/2, not  b / 2, which divides.
red>> b: [11 22 33 44]
red>> b/2
== 22
 
;with a paren! in a path
red>> b/(1 + 2)
== 33

red>> n: 1
red>> b/(n + 1)
== 22

;here, b has a nested block at position 4
red>> b: [11 22 33 [444 555] 66]
;get element 4, position 1
red>> b/4/1
== 444

;now with words, not literal numbers
red>> x: 4
red>> y: 1

;get element with a get-path! Note preceding : (more on this below)
red>> b/:x/:y
== 444

;set elementwith a set-path! Note following : (more on this below)
red>> b/:x/:y: 1111
== 1111
;note the changed value
red>> b
== [11 22 33 [1111 555] 66]

;with symbols - here, the value AFTER the symbol is returned
red>> sales: [UK 10000 USA 15000 China 33000]
red>> sales/USA
== 15000

.box Path Examples With Refinement 

Many function words use 'refinements' to modify their action.  Here is 
$$sort$$ with its reverse refinement:
red>> ages: [55  33 73 73 19]
red>> sort/reverse ages
== [73 73 55 33 19]

Using Paths - set/get/lit Paths  
-------------------------------

When we use colons or ticks in a path, the type of the path becomes a 
$$set-path!$$, a $$get-path!$$, or a $$lit-path$$. This is similar in 
concept to $$get-word!$$, $$set-word!$$ and $$lit-word!$$.

If we have a block such as:

b: [11 22 33 44]

then we can use numbers in a straightforward way, as in:

b/2        ; get element at position 2
b/2: 2222  ; set element at position 2

With words used as variables, we must use $$set-path!$$ and $$get-path!$$ 
types, as in:

red>> b/:x/:y           ;get-path! type

red>> b/:x/:y: 1111     'set-path! type


We can also use a $$lit-path!$$ type, as in:

'b/x

which evaluates to 

b/x


Paths As Series
---------------

A path is a series, and its elements can be accessed with the $$series!$$ functions.  

Here, the first [block] is used to prevent evaluation

red>> second first [the/white/cat]
== white
