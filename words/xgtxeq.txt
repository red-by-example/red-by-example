The infix word $$>=$$ loosely compares operands on its left and right side and
returns $$true$$ if the operand on the left is greater than or equal to the operand
on the right. Otherwise returns $$false$$.

Has 2 operands of any $$datatype!$$.

Loose comparison means that:
    - the case of strings is ignored when comparing
    - same numeric values for different datatypes are considered equal
