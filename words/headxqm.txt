The word $$head?$$ checks whether a $$series!$$ index is at the $$head$$
position (= position 1) and returns $$true$$ if it is at $$head$$ or $$false$$ 
otherwise.

Note that you can use the word $$index?$$ to obtain the current index!

red>> x: [1 2 3]
== [1 2 3]

red>> head? x
== true

red>> index? x
== 1

red>> x: next x
== [2 3]

red>> head? x
== false

red>> index? x
== 2
