The word $$read$$ reads and returns data from a $$file!$$.  

The argument must be a $$file!$$ type.

Refinements:
    /binary -   reads, and preserves contents exactly
    /lines  -   reads lines of text, placing them in a $$block!$$ of $$string!$$s.
    /info   -   
    /part
    /as
    /seek

%%The following example was executed on Windows, using a text file created with%%
%%Notepad, and placed in the same folder as the program. The file contains 2 lines:%%

%%LINE1%%
%%LINE2%%

%%Inside the file, the end of each line is marked by a CRLF pair.%%
%%However, when Red reads the data as text, it presents the data to us with only%%
%%the LF character at the end, just as on Linux.%%
