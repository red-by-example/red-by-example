The word $$file!$$ is a $$datatype!$$; it can be a: 
    file name
    directory name
    directory $$path!$$. 
    
A file! is a type of $$series!$$, rather like a string. 
Note that this type is concerned with file names and places, rather than the contents of a file.

Here are some file! examples
    %file.txt
    %directory/
    %directory/my%20stuff/file.txt
    %"directory/my stuff/file.txt"
    %/c/windows/softwaredistribution

Notes:
    - a $$file!$$ literal must always start with a percent sign %
    - use forward slashes / (Unix style); back slashes will be automagically converted to /

Unusual characters in file names must be encoded with a % hexadecimal number, 
such as %20 for space.  Thus, my%20stuff refers to "my stuff"; alternatively, 
we may enclose them in "quotes", and Red generates the hexadecimal codes for us.
.pre
.box The file! as a series!
red>> find %top/work/red/demo.txt "red"
== %red/demo.txt

.box Use a file! to manipulate contents: load, save
red>> save %demo.txt "some data for a file"

red>> print load %demo.txt
##some data for a file##
