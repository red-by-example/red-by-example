An $$object$$ is a container that groups data and/or functions within 
one variable.

Red implements 'prototype-based objects'. 

Creating new $$object$$s is done by cloning existing $$object$$s 
or the base $$object!$$ value. 

During the creation process, existing field values can be modified 
and new fields can be added. 

It is a very simple and efficient model to encapsulate your Red code.
.pre
%%$$make$$ an $$object$$ - a pretend square box%%
box: make object! [
  size: 10
  show: function [] [
    print ["Showing size =" size "from within the box!"]
  ]
]

%%Use the encapsulated function%%
box/show
##Showing size = 10 from within the box!##
