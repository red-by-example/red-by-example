The word $$select$$ finds a value in a $$series!$$ and if succesful returns 
the element right after the element found. Returns $$none$$ if the search fails.

Select is similar to the $$find$$ function. 

The 2 arguments are:
    a series    -   of type $$series!$$  $$any-object!$$  $$map!$$  $$none!$$
    a value     -   of any type 

Refinements
    /part       - Limit the length (a $$number!$$) of the search or a $$series!$$ reference.
    /only       - Treat a series search value as a single value.
    /case       - Perform a case-sensitive search.
    /any        - Use * and ? wildcards in string searches.
    /with       - Use custom wildcards * or ?.
    /skip       - Treat the series as fixed size records.  Requires an $$integer!$$ size.
    /last       - Find the last occurrence of value (from the $$tail$$).
    /reverse    - Find the last occurrence of value (from the current index).

.pre
.box Select a month, return item following it
red>> months: ["Mar" 31 "April" 30 "May" 31]
== ["Mar" 31 "April" 30 "May" 31]

red>> select Months "April"
== 30

red>> select Months 30
== "May"                     %%Beware that select can match any element!%%

.box Select a character in a $$string!$$ (after D)
red>> str: "ABCDEFGH"
== "ABCDEFGH"

red>> select str "D"
== #"E"                      %%Because E follows the found element D%%

.box /pairs - do a normal select, then use /pairs
red>> pairs: [44 4 3 33 4 55]
== [44 4 3 33 4 55]

red>> select pairs 4
== 3                         %%Because 3 follows the found element 4%%

.box Select only matches the first element in a skip group
red>> select/skip pairs 4 2
== 55

.box Search form the tail
red>> animal: "The black cat"
== "The black cat"

red>> select/last animal "a"
== #"t"

.box Using the /only refinement
red>> blk: [11 12 13 [22 33 44] 15]
== [11 12 13 [22 33 44] 15]

red>> select blk 13
== [22 33 44]
 
red>> select blk [22 33 44]
== none             %%Not found, because we searched for a $$series!$$%%
 
red>> select/only blk [22 33 44]
15 

red>> select/only blk [22 33 44]
== 15               %%Success! With /only we can search for a $$series!$$%%

.box Search backwards from a position with the /reverse refinement
red>> words: "a-few-words"
== "a-few-words"
 
red>> current: find/last words "-"
"-words"

red>> current: find/last words "-"
== "-words"

red>> index? current
== 6

red>> select/reverse current "-"
== #"f"
