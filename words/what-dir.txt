The word $$what-dir$$ returns the active directory path as a $$file!$$ value.

It has no arguments.

Irrespective of the operating system, it uses / in file paths.

Literal file paths must start with the % sign:
   So, e.g. c:\windows\system32 must be represented as %/c/windows/system32
.pre
a: what-dir
== %/C/rebol/

type? a
== file!
