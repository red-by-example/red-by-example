The $$datatype!$$ $$get-word!$$ is the way in which Red gets values from a variable.

The $$get-word!$$ type gets the value of a word (which is quite normal thus 
far) but does not evaluate the value. For that we use a colon in front of  
a variable.

For many simple data types, the result is the value. For special $$datatype!$$s
like functions, we need to use the get-word notation.

.box Use $$get-word!$$ type
red>> w: 123
== 123

red>> w
== 123

red>> :w
== 123                            %%For normal variable same as evaluating it%%

red>> f: func [] [print "Hi!"]
== func [][print "Hi!"]

red>> f                           %%Evaluate the function%%
Hi!

red>> :f                          %%Use the get-word - retrieve the definition of f%%
== func [][print "Hi!"]
