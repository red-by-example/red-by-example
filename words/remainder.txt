The word $$remainder$$ returns the rest of dividing the first by the second value.

Has 2 arguments of type:
    $$number!$$ $$char!$$ $$pair!$$ $$tuple!$$ $$vector!$$

It is the functional version of the infix word $$//$$.

If the first argument is positive, then the remainder is positive.

If the first argument is negative, then the remainder is negative,
as in remainder -5 4, which results in -1.

If the first argument is zero, then the remainder is also zero.

If the second argument is zero, a run-time error occurs.
