Accepts a block of items, reduces them, and joins them together.  No 
spaces are inserted between items.  The rejoined item is returned, and the
original block is unaltered.

REBOL users please note - Red does not have 'join'.

Arguments
    A block.


Examples

.box Some simple rejoins - note the string! result
>> b: ["sum is " 3 + 2]
== ["sum is " 3 + 2]
>> rejoin b
== "sum is 5"
>> type? rejoin b
== string!

>> b2: [3 + 4 " is result"]
== [3 + 4 " is result"]
>> rejoin b2
== "7 is result"

.box Join some blocks - note the appended series
>> rejoin [b b2]
== ["sum is " 3 + 2 [3 + 4 " is result"]]

.box The $$tag!$$ type acts differently. The result is a tag! type
>> rejoin [&lt;a href=test.html&gt; "test" &lt;/a&gt;]
>> &lt;a href=test.htmltest&lt;/a&gt;&gt;

;-- we could convert to strings to get a more useful result:
>> rejoin ["&lt;a href=test.html&gt;" "test" &lt;/a&gt;]
== "&lt;a href=test.html&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;"
